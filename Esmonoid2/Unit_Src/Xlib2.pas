	XLibPas v2.0 is a set of libraries and utilities that allow you to use some
	extended features of the standard VGA adapter which are not exploited in
	mode 13h. The most important features are :
		- Use of all of the 256k of standard VGA memory
		- Several tweaked resolutions, all in 256 colours
		- Multiple pages, double- and triple-buffering, page flipping
				and panning
		- Split screen
		- Planar, Video and Compiled bitmaps
		- Drawing procedures (line,circle,pixel,boxes,filling,polygons)
		- Text handling supporting user fonts
		- Archiving and compression
		- GIF/BMP encoding and decoding
		- Bitmap scaling
		- Virtual VSync handler
		- Mouse routines
		- Palette handling
		- ...and (at long last) Protected Mode (experimental)}

	This function initialises the graphics system, setting the apropriate
	screen resolution and allocating a virtual screen. The virtual screen
	allocated may not necessarily be of the same size as specified in the
	WidthInPixels parameter as it is rounded down to the nearest

	This function activates Mode X split screen and sets starting scan line
	The split screen resides on the bottom half of the screen and has a
	starting address of A000:0000 in video RAM.

	It also Updates Page0Offs to reflect the existence of the split screen
	region ie MainScrnOffset is set to the offset of the first pixel
	beyond the split screen region. Other variables set are #Page1Offs# which
	is set to the same value as #Page0Offs# (see graphics call sequence below),
	#ScrnLogicalHeight#,#ScrnPhysicalHeight#, #SplitScrnScanLine# and
	#MaxScrollY#.

	This function cannot be called after double buffering has been activated,
	it will return an error. To configure your graphics environment the
	sequence of graphics calls is as follows although either or both steps b
	and c may be omitted:
		a) #XSetMode#
		b) #XSetSplitScreen#
		c) #XSetDoubleBuffer#
	Thus when you call this function successfully, double buffering is not
	active so #Page1Offs# is set to the same address as #Page0Offs#.

	WARNING: If you use one of the high resolution modes (376x564 as an
	extreme example) you may not have enough video ram for split screen
	and double buffering options since VGA video RAM is restricted to 64K.}

	This function sets up two double buffering virtual pages. ErrorValue
	is set according to the success or failure of this command.

	Other variables set are:

		#Page1Offs#            -  Offset of second virtual page
		#NonVisualOffs#        -  Offset of first non visible video ram byte
		#DoubleBufferActive#   -  Flag
		#ScrnLogicalHeight#    -  Logical height of the double buffering pages
		#MaxScrollY#           -  Max vertical start address of physical screen

Procedure XSetTripleBuffer( PageHeight : word );
{ This procedure behaves like #XDoubleBuffer#, but when used with
	#XInstallVSyncHandler# you can draw immediately after a page flip.

Procedure XPageFlip( X, Y : Word );
{ X,Y - coordinates of top left corner of physical screen within the
	the hidden virtual screen if double buffering is active, or
	the current virtual screen otherwise.

	Sets the physical screen start address within currently hidden virtual
	page and then flips pages. If double buffering is not active then this
	function is functionally equivalent to #XSetStartAddr#.

	Mode X rectangle 4x4 pattern fill routine.

	Upper left corner of pattern is always aligned to a multiple-of-4
	row and column. Works on all VGAs. Uses approach of copying the
	pattern to off-screen display memory, then loading the latches with
	the pattern for each scan line and filling each scan line four
	pixels at a time. Fills up to but not including the column at EndX
	and the row at EndY. No clipping is performed.

		DestOffs      - Offset of destination page

	Copies the contents of page SourceOffs to DestOffs. Twice as fast as a
	#XCpVidRect# would be (because it uses less parameters, so less stack work is
	required).}
Procedure XCpVidRect( SrcStartX,SrcStartY,SrcEndX,SrcEndY,DestStartX,
					DestStartY,SrcPageBase,DestPageBase,SrcBitmapW,
					DestBitmapW:word );

					containing the destination rectangle

	Mode X display memory to display memory copy
	routine. Left edge of source rectangle modulo 4 must equal left edge
	of destination rectangle modulo 4. Works on all VGAs. Uses approach
	of reading 4 pixels at a time from the source into the latches, then
	writing the latches to the destination. Copies up to but not
	including the column at SrcEndX and the row at SrcEndY. No
	clipping is performed. Results are not guaranteed if the source and
	destination overlap.
	If you want to copy an entire page to another use #XCpVidPage# instead}

		SrcRight, SrcBottom - Coordinates of lower right hand corner of rectangle
		DestLeft, DestTop - Coordinates of upper left corner of destination
		ScreenOffs    - Offset of virtual screen

	This function copies a rectangle of VRAM onto another area of VRAM,
	even if the destination overlaps with the source.  It is designed
	for scrolling text up and down, and for moving large areas of screens
	around in tiling systems.  It rounds all horizontal coordinates to
	the nearest byte (4-column chunk) for the sake of speed.  This means
	that it can NOT perform smooth horizontal scrolling.  For that,
	either scroll the whole screen (minus the split screen), or copy
	smaller areas through system memory using the functions in the
	#XBM2# module.

	SrcRight is rounded up, and the left edges are rounded down, to
	ensure that the pixels pointed to by the arguments are inside the
	the rectangle.  That is, SrcRight is treated as (SrcRight+3) >> 2,
	and SrcLeft as SrcLeft >> 2.

	The width of the rectangle in bytes (width in pixels / 4)
	cannot exceed 255.}

Procedure XPolygon( var vertices; numvertices, Color, PageOffset:word );
{ This function is similar to the triangle function but draws
	convex polygons. The vertices are supplied as an array of vertices.

	NOTE: a convex polygon is one such that if you draw a line from
	any two vertices, every point on that line will be within the
	polygon.

	This function works by splitting up a polygon into its component
	triangles and calling the triangle routine above to draw each one.
	Performance is respectable but a custom polygon routine might be
	faster.}

		MouseColor - The colour to use when drawing the mouse cursor.

	Define a mouse cursor shape for use in subsequent cursor redraws. XLib
	has a hardwired mouse cursor size of 8 pixels across by 14 pixels down.

	WARNING: This function assumes MouseDef points to 14 bytes.

	Note: Bit order is in reverse. ie bit 7 represents pixel 0 ..
		bit 0 represents pixel 7 in each MouseDef byte.}
Function XMouseExists : Boolean;
function XMouseInit:integer;
{	Initialize the mouse driver functions and install the mouse event handler
	function. This is the first function you must call before using any of the
	mouse functions. This mouse code uses the fastest possible techniques to
	save and restore mouse backgrounds and to draw the mouse cursor.

	WARNING: This function uses and updates NonVisualOffset to allocate
		 video ram for the saved mouse background.

	LIMITATIONS: No clipping is supported horizontally for the mouse cursor
				 No validity checking is performed for NonVisualOffs

	**WARNING** You must Hide or at least Freeze the mouse cursor while drawing
	using any of the other XLIB procedures since the mouse handler may
	modify vga register settings at any time. VGA register settings
	are not preserved which will result in unpredictable drawing behavior.
	If you know the drawing will occur away from the mouse cursor set
	#MouseFrozen# to 1, do your drawing  then set it to 0.
	Alternatively call #XHideMouse#, perform your drawing and then call
	#XShowMouse#. Another alternative is to disable interrupts while drawing
	but usually drawing takes up alot of time and having interrupts
	disabled for too long is not a good idea.
	If you are using the Virtual VSync Handler and just updating the palette
	you don't need to freeze the mouse.}
Procedure XMouseWindow( x0, y0, x1, y1:word );
{	Defines a mouse window. The mouse can't move outside the boundaries
	specified.}
procedure XShowMouse;

Procedure XPositionMouse( X, Y : word );
{	Positions the mouse at a specified location}
Procedure XUpdateMouse;
{	Forces the mouse position to be updated and cursor to be redrawn.
	Note: this function is useful when you have set #MouseFrozen# to true.
	Allows the cursor position to be updated manually rather than
	automatically by the installed handler.}
Function  XFloodFill( X, Y, PgOfs, Color:word ) : word;
{	This function performs the familiar flood filling used by many
	paint programs and of course the Borland BGI's flood fill function.
	The pixel at x,y and all adjacent pixels of the same color are filled
	to the new color. Filling stops when there are no more adjacent pixels
	of the original pixel's color. The function returns the number of
	pixels that have been filled.}
Function  XBoundaryFill( X, Y, PgOfs, BoundaryColor, Color : word ) : word;
{	This function is a variant of the flood fill described above. This
	function, unlike the above function, can fill across color boundaries.
	Filling stops when the area being filled is fully enclosed by pixels
	of the color boundary. Again, this function returns the number of
	pixels filled.}
Procedure XInstallVSyncHandler( VrtsToSkip : word );
{	This function installs the vsync handler using timer 0. It's called
	about 100 microseconds before every vertical retrace.

	The VrtsToSkip value (>=1) defines the delay in VRT's between consecutive
	physical screen start address changes, thus allowing you to limit the
	maximum frame rate for page flips in animation systems. The frame rate
	is calculated as Vertical refresh rate / VrtsToSkip, eg for
	320x240 mode which refreshes at 60Hz a VrtsToSkip value of 3 will result
	in a maximum page flipping rate of 20Hz (frames per second)

	WARNING:  Be sure to remove it before exiting.
	When used with a debugger, the system clock may speed up.
}
Procedure XRemoveVSyncHandler;
{	This routine MUST be called before exiting (or aborting) the program,
	or your system will crash.}
Procedure XSetUserVSyncHandler( handler : pointer );
{	Installs a user routine to be called once each vertical retrace. The user
	handler has its own stack of 256 bytes.
	WARNING: This installs an interrupt driven handler, beware of the following:
		 Only 8086 registers are preserved. If you're using 386 code, save
		 all the 386 regs.
		 Don't do any drawing.
		 Don't call any DOS functions.

	So why use it?
	Well, you can update global variables if you're careful. And it's nice for
	palette animation. You can even do fades while loading from disk. You
	should use this instead of installing your own int08h routine and chain
	to the original.}
